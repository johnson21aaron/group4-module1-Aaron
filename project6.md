Scrum
Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment,
with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research,
 sales, marketing and advanced technologies.It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, 
who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints,
 no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. 
The Scrum Team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called daily scrums 
(a form of stand-up meeting). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: 
the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, 
and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve.
The fundamental unit of scrum is a small team of people, consisting of a product owner, a scrum master, and developers. 
The team is self-managing, cross-functional and focuses on one objective at a time: the product goal.

Product owner
The product owner, representing the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer (or may represent the desires of a committee), 
is responsible for delivering good business results. Hence, the product owner is accountable for the product backlog 
and for maximizing the value that the team delivers.The product owner defines the product in terms of customer-centric outcomes 
(typically - but not limited to - user stories), adds them to the product backlog, and prioritizes them based on importance and dependencies.
A scrum team should have only one product owner (although a product owner could support more than one team) and 
it is strongly advised against combining this role with the role of the scrum master. The product owner should focus on the business side of product development 
and spend the majority of time liaising with stakeholders and the team. The product owner does not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution,
but seeks consensus among team members.[better source needed] This role is crucial and requires a deep understanding of both sides: the business 
and the engineers (developers) in the scrum team. Therefore, a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it 
(because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the developers using technical language, as required. 
The product owner uses scrum's empirical tools to manage highly complex work while controlling risk and achieving value.
Communication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to
steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, 
serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.
As the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:

*Define and announce releases.
*Communicate delivery and product status.
*Share progress during governance meetings.
*Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.
*Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.
*Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.

Empathy is a key attribute for a product owner to haveâ€”the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders 
with a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives - and should be able to appreciate these different points of view. To be effective, 
it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The developers need thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a 
product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest 
and waste time. A direct means of communication is preferred by seasoned product owners.
A product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities 
between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.

Developers
The developers carry out all work required to build increments of value every sprint.
The term developers refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects,
designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.
However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as team members.
The team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from 
distractions, the team are encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.

Scrum master
Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.
The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a barrier between the team and any distracting influences. The scrum master ensures
that the scrum framework is followed by coaching the team in scrum theory and concepts, often facilitating key sessions, and encourages the team to grow and to improve.
The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator or servant-leader to reinforce these dual perspectives.
The core responsibilities of a scrum master include (but are not limited to):
* Helping the product owner maintain the product backlog in a way that ensures the needed work is well understood so the team can continually make forward progress
* Helping the team to determine the definition of done for the product, with input from key stakeholders
* Coaching the team, within the scrum principles, in order to deliver high-quality features for its product
* Educating key stakeholders and the rest of the organization on scrum (and possibly agile) principles
* Helping the scrum team avoid or remove impediments to its progress, whether internal or external to the team
* Promoting self-organization and cross-functionality within the team
* Facilitating team events to ensure regular progress
* The scrum master helps people and organizations adopt empirical and lean thinking, leaving behind hopes for certainty and predictability.

One of the ways the scrum master role differs from a project manager is that the latter may have people management responsibilities and the scrum master does not. 
A scrum master provides a limited amount of direction since the team is expected to be empowered and self-organizing.Scrum does not formally recognize the role of 
project manager, as traditional command and control tendencies would cause difficulties.
